Rapunzel is new to the SAP world and very interessted in Back-End development. She wants to focus on the modern parts of ABAP programming within S/4HANA and the BTP, therefore she wants to get her hands dirty with the new ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (*RAP*) and everything surrounding it.

## What is *Rap*unzel capable of?

When Rapunzel has finished the first three major steps of the given Learning Path, she is able to get staffed in upcoming development projects (customer or product). She already has basic knowledge in all of the needed skills and looking forward to get project experience in order to deepen her knowledge. This is important as she has no real “expert knowledge yet” – therefore it is a must-have to also have an experienced lead developer in the project as well, which helps her taking the first steps in “real life”.

## Why does msg need more *Rap*unzel´s?

For msg, it is important to have many developers like Rapunzel. With the incoming end of SAP ECC maintenance and the rise of the ABAP environment in BTP and also Embedded Steampunk, RAP is *the* skill to invest for ABAP development. Upcoming projects based on modern SAP systems will be majorly implemented with RAP in the Back-End, therefore it is crucial for msg to have a lot of girls (and guys) like Rapunzel.

## Why do you want to be like *Rap*unzel?

If you are new to the SAP world (or at least to cloud application programming), it is important to have SAP’s future strategy in mind. If you become a *Captain*, you are prepared for the next years (maybe even decades) of back-end development in the SAP ecosystem. Team leads of upcoming projects will fight for you to make sure that you will be part of their development team.​
